# Monte Carlo Simulation – Euler–Maruyama Scheme  

## Project Overview  
This project implements **Monte Carlo (MC) methods** for simulating stochastic processes in finance, using the **Euler–Maruyama (EM) scheme**. The notebook demonstrates how stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be discretized and simulated numerically to estimate option prices and analyze convergence properties.  

Monte Carlo methods are widely used in **quantitative finance** for:  
- Pricing derivatives (European, Asian, Barrier options)  
- Risk management and Value-at-Risk estimation  
- Stress testing and portfolio optimization  

The focus of this project is on **Euler–Maruyama**, a widely used numerical approximation for simulating SDEs such as **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**, which underpins the Black–Scholes model.
